# Global-Temperatures

Global Temperatures is a project that aims to find an effective machine learning algorithm that can predict whether a Twitter user supports the belief in man-made climate change. By using four term-level features and comparing two classification algorithms (i.e. decision tree and support vector machine), this initiative seeks to determine which model can serve as a better aid in knowing who to reach out to in climate change awareness campaigns.
